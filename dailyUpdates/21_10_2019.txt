Began work with astropy, a python library aimed at astrophysics and image processing. 

Using this library I reproduces some of my FITS files. 

I also began work looking into the correct process in which to reduce my image using the bias, dark and flats. 

The corrected image can be expressed as; Raw - ((Dark + Bias)/Flat)

I have been unable to produce a combined image yet. I am getting th efollowing error when I try concatenate the images together.
TypeError: stat: path should be string, bytes, os.PathLike or integer, not method

My code is currently one test file as shown here.
